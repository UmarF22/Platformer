The project is a simple platformer game where players control a character to navigate through various levels, overcoming obstacles, collecting items, and reaching the end goal. The theme of the game is adventure-based, encouraging players to test their reflexes and problem-solving skills. I chose this project because platformer games are both engaging and challenging to develop. This project allows us to apply and showcase our knowledge of GUI design, object-oriented programming, and game logic.
